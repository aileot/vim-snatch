# vim-snatch

Snatch texts, from Insert/Command mode, by motion.

## Concept

- Unnecessary to set any extra `:nmap`pings/`:omap`pings for `{motion}`.

- Acceptive of text-objects: `iw`, `a[`, ...

  (To be honest, since the feature works with `TextYankPost`,
  you have to type `yiw`, or `da[`, etc.,
  but it won't mess up your register or clipboard.)

- Friendly with the existing mappings of the fantastic plugins:

  - [easymotion/vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion)
  - [deris/vim-shot-f](https://github.com/deris/vim-shot-f)
  - Text-objects of [machakann/vim-sandwich](https://github.com/machakann/vim-sandwich)
  - ...

## Installation

Install the plugin using your favorite package manager.

This is a sample configuration in TOML format
for [Dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) users:

```toml
[[plugin]]
repo = 'kaile256/vim-snatch'
lazy = 1
on_event = ['CmdlineEnter', 'InsertEnter']
```

## Usage

(The following options, mappings, and so on, are not all the features this
plugin provides.
Type `:h snatch`,
[doc/snatch.txt](https://github.com/kaile256/vim-snatch/blob/main/doc/snatch.txt)
will tell you more features and their details.)

### Options

```vim
" As long as the registers are used to snatch, this plugin will never override the register.
" Default: '0'
let g:snatch#clean_registers = '0"abc'

" Set an action for the case that cursor attempts to go out of current window.
" Set an empty string to disable it. As default, sneaking process will start
" after jumping to last accessed window in the case. It's useful in editing
" git-commit message.
let g:snatch#ins#attempt_to_escape_from_window = "\<C-c>\<C-w>p"

" default
let g:snatch#cmd#position_marker = 'â”ƒ'

" Set it to `0` to disable this option; otherwise, this option lets vim-snatch
" make sure to restore cursor highlight after having snatched. If you have any
" problem with this option, please reopen issue #46 or, referring to the issue,
" open a new one, and report the problem.
" default: 1
let g:snatch#force_restore_cursor_highlight = 1
```

### Status

You can watch current snatch status by `g:snatch_status`.

```vim
" Add the snippet in your vimrc before any other scripts that use
" g:snatch_status unless you're sure it's unnecessary.
if !exists('g:snatch_status')
  let g:snatch_status = {}
endif
```

If you'd like to leave insert mode, add the snippets below in your vimrc.

```vim
augroup Snatch/InsertLeaveAfterSnatching
  autocmd!
  " Note: `:stopinsert` instead is useless here.
  autocmd User SnatchInsertPost if g:snatch_status.prev_mode ==# 'i' |
        \   call feedkeys("\<Esc>")
        \ | endif
augroup END
" Or
augroup Snatch/InsertLeaveAfterSnatchingButOperatorC
  autocmd!
  autocmd User SnatchInsertPost if g:snatch_status.prev_mode ==# 'i'
        \ && v:operator !=# 'c' |
        \   call feedkeys("\<Esc>l")
        \ | endif
augroup END
```

### Mappings

This plugin provides several `<Plug>`-mappings.
Each mappings will snatch text by either motion or intercepting it from the
register.

```vim
" Default mappings
cmap <C-o> <Plug>(snatch-by-register)

smap <C-y> <Plug>(snatch-by-register-ctrl-y)
smap <C-e> <Plug>(snatch-by-register-ctrl-e)

imap <C-g><C-o> <Plug>(snatch-by-register)
imap <C-g><C-y> <Plug>(snatch-by-register-ctrl-y)
imap <C-g><C-e> <Plug>(snatch-by-register-ctrl-e)
imap <C-g><C-p> <Plug>(snatch-by-register-wincmd-p)

" Note: Without the check on pumvisible() in mapping, vim-snatch will interrupt
" current completion to start sneaking.
imap <expr> <C-y> pumvisible() ? '<Plug>(snatch-completion-confirm)' : '<Plug>(snatch-by-register-ctrl-y)'
imap <expr> <C-e> pumvisible() ? '<Plug>(snatch-completion-cancel)'  : '<Plug>(snatch-by-register-ctrl-e)'
```

You can disable the default mappings with the script below.

```vim
let g:snatch#no_default_mappings = 1
```

#### Use as Operator

This plugin doesn't provide operator mappings directly, but we have a simple
solution to start snatching in Operator-pending mode at a breath.

```vim
let g:snatch#clean_registers = '0' " (default)
imap <C-y> <Plug>(snatch-by-register-ctrl-y)y
" Or use <SID> if your `y` is mapped:
inoremap <SID>y y
imap <SID>(snatch-operator-ctrl-y) <Plug>(snatch-by-register-ctrl-y)<SID>y
imap <C-y> <SID>(snatch-operator-ctrl-y)
```

#### Deal with popup menu

We should set alternative key sequences in the case `pumvisible()` returns `1`
(usually in completion);
otherwise, we would let [vim-snatch](https://github.com/kaile256/vim-snatch)
do unexpected behavior. You have options:

- Just use default mappings. You don't have to care about the matter any
  longer.
- Map arbitrary keys to as many of the provided `<Plug>`-mappings as your
  preference. See the example below:

```vim
let g:snatch#no_default_mappings = 1
" This is mere a copy of the default mappings, but it's useful if you'd like
" to use its mappings as a trigger for lazy load of some plugin manager such as
" dein.vim.
imap <C-g><C-y> <Plug>(snatch-oneshot-hor-or-reg-ctrl-y)
imap <C-g><C-e> <Plug>(snatch-oneshot-hor-or-reg-ctrl-e)
imap <expr> <C-y> pumvisible() ? '<Plug>(snatch-completion-confirm)' : '<Plug>(snatch-oneshot-hor-or-reg-ctrl-y)'
imap <expr> <C-e> pumvisible() ? '<Plug>(snatch-completion-cancel)' : '<Plug>(snatch-oneshot-hor-or-reg-ctrl-e)'
```
